# DP-Pack

This is the source coding of the paper "DP-Pack: Distributed Parallel Packing for FPGAs".

The coding is based on VPR tool of VTR 7.0. We develop the distributed parallel version of the packing stage 
of VPR with MPI. So the OpenMPI supports are needed to compile the code.

To use the code, just replace the VPR tool with DP-Pack and recompile the VTR 7.0.
